## Hi, I’m @xavier-fenton.


I am currently building web applications. 
I am slowly wanting to intergrate my practice into more software based products. For now, I'll focus the Web Development...


### Other Projects I want to make:

1. Pomodoro timer with a language like Python for my Raspberry Pi 3. With a digital touch display. This will help manage my time when I am working on projects.

## CurrentProject: 

#### 1. Romily Marbrook Writer Blog
